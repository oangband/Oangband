TODO list:
- Upgrade and sync code with Vanilla, focusing on the main-xxx and z-xxxx files.

- Study how pseudo-id works in Vanilla and if it is appropriate to adopt it.

- Remove amnesia attacks.

- No sell option.

- Look over the build system and consider possible replacements for
  GNU autohell.

- Change the way dungeon lit up under infra-vision - red instead of
  yellow.

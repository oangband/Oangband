=== General Info ===

This is the readme file for Oangband 1.1.0 (3 Jan 2006)

     Oangband is a variant of Angband, created to experiment with
changes in melee algorithms, monster AI, spells, items, a substantial
reduction in both HPs and damage, and whatever else might both catch
the maintainer's fancy and be practicable for him to code.
Appropriately, it is called Opinion-Angband, or Oangband for short.

     On-line help exists for all significant changes made, so make
certain you have a look through at least some of the new help
documents available through the "?" command.  In addition, the file
containing the complete list of changes from version 0.5.5 to 1.1.0
can be found in the lib/files directory.

     Oangband is based on Angband 2.8.3.  I hope you will join me in a
paean of praise to Ben Harrison, whose excellent code has made so many
variants of Angband possible.  Oangband 0.5.0 adapted a large amount
of code from Angband 2.8.5-2.9.1.

     Oangband was created by Leon Marrick and has had numerous
contributers over the years.  I would especially like to thank Christer
J. Nyfalt for his numerous code reviews of recent releases.

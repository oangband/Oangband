TODO list:
- Upgrade and sync code with Vanilla, focusing on the main-xxx and z-xxxx files.

- Study how pseudo-id works in Vanilla and if it is appropriate to adopt it.

- Remove amnesia attacks.

- No sell option.

- Look over the build system and consider possible replacements for
  GNU autohell.

- Change the way dungeon lit up under infra-vision - red instead of
  yellow. Warm-blooded monsters red, cold-blooded grey?


From Bahman Rabii:
For what it's worth, in the unlikely event that I start working
actively, Oangband is FAR from done. There are a huge number of
fundamental gameplay improvements still waiting to happen. Some would
require heavy refactoring, some would not. My gameplay priorities:
- Further improvement to AI. This would really want a cleaner internal
API for the AI module. Add cooldowns to monsters spells; and make the
monsters even smarter.
- Further reductions in tedium. Even fewer, even better drops. Remove
the incentive to grind for consumables. Further rework stat gain.
- Extend the idea of archery spells with more combat magic.
- Give more nifty tricks to Warriors, but without losing the pure
fighter feel. Possibly by implementing combat techniques as
activations or side effects for weapons and/or armor. Also with more
warrior-friendly sources of shapeshifting.
- Make the early game a little more forgiving. Ramp up late game difficulty.
- Solve the big-three balance breaking abilities: Banishment,
Teleport-Away, Destruction.
- Reduce the role of speed. Add in more "specialized speed" for
casting, combat, and archery. Somehow make this smoother and less
confusing than it currently is (i.e. specialized speed to affect
cooldowns rather than
- Add cooldowns to many player abilities and rebalance around them.
- Add good things from Angband: gain/lose potions, new identify
semantics, no_sell as default
- Generally rebalance artifact weapons. Some are way too general
(*cough* Ulmo *cough*) and I would like to make sure each class always
have different favorites.
- Reduce damage spikiness in the late game, and restrict high-end healing.

Fixes to things I was never really happy with:
- Set items. Maybe ditch them.
- Variable weapon dice. These are great, but they need to interact
better with squelching and pseudo-id.
- The Ent player race. I don't know... they are super cool, and yet
they feel weird.
- Druids are too good at too many things. Maybe move martial arts to
the specialty list for them, rather than default?
- Remove some of the more boring specialities and develop/balance/add
the ones that really affect gameplay.
